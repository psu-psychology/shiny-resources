# shiny-resources

Resources for building simple Shiny apps.
Rick Gilmore prepared these for teaching [PSY 511: Transparent, Open, and Reproducible Research Practices in the Social and Behavioral Sciences](http://psu-psychology.github.io/psy-511-reproducible-research-spring-2017/) in Spring 2017.
He modified them in teaching [PSY 525: Transparent, Open, and Reproducible Research Practices in the Social and Behavioral Sciences](https://psu-psychology.github.io/psy-525-reproducible-research-2020/) in Spring 2020.
The files now have their own repo for easier access by students.

## Instructions

- Clone the repository.
- From the repository's root directory, render the accompanying R Markdown file using `rmarkdown::render("shiny-templates/shiny-work.Rmd")`. *Note:* The file contains embedded Shiny app code that requires a local version of R to work.
- The resulting file is an interactive HTML document that provides further guidance.
